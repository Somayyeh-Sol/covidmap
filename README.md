# covidmap
In this project I draw a World map by React leaflet and use John Hopkin's university 's Data Api to show the confirmed case of covid 19 in all countries , as well as a demonstration by a legend to show a scale to which countries have more confirmed cases.
I use React components , Function components , React Hooks (UseState and UseEffect ), Bootstrap for loading Page, Rest API s , React Leaflet and GeoJson to draw the map, Papaparse  to convert the data and class components.
